# trump-the-trump
This is a gamer Yuhei Hattori, Jack Liu, and I made during our summer CS project in 2016.  
It was the election year and we were meming on Trump. We meming about the small loan of a million dollars and the wall. Who would have guessed... 
This project is intended to be a funny meme that is somewhat fun. We don't mean to offend or harm anyone.
Fianlly I hope you enjoy the game :)
