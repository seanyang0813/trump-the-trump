This is a gamer Yuhei Hattori, Jack Liu, and I made during our summer CS project in 2016.  

It was the election year and we were meming on Trump. We meming about the small loan of a million dollars and the wall. Who would have guessed... 

This project is intended to be a meme game that is somewhat fun. We don't mean to offend or harm anyone.

Fianlly I hope you enjoy the game :)
